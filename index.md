Hello all! I am Vikrant Goyal, a 3rd year undergraduate student from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. I am pursuing my research in NLP and Machine Translation.

The following list of blog posts will be related to my **Google Summer of Code**'s project : **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation for TV News**, and a detailed account of my adventures, what I learned during the summer, problems I faced and how finally I overcame those.

I by and large attempt to deliver as per documented in my GSoC proposal. I will endeavor to record each one of the deviations from the solutions / approaches as proposed and settled on in the proposal.
