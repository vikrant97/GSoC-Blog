Hi there,

I am Ahmed Ismail, a research assistant at [Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering](http://eng.cu.edu.eg/en/), and a Master's student at [Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Informatics](https://www.fci.cu.edu.eg/). My main interest is **machine learning** and its applications in the field of **computational linguistics**.

I am currently working on [*Senteech*](http://www.dataplusme.com/senteech.html), a collaborative research project with [DataPlusME](http://www.dataplusme.com/) that aims to develop a **speech emotion recognizer** to aid call centers easily find angry calls within their huge data sets.

I also previously worked with [RDI-eg](http://www.rdi-eg.com/) on [the *Hafss* project](http://www.rdi-eg.com/Technologies/speech.htm), a pronunciation learning application for Islam's Holy Book (the Quran). In this project, I explored various deep neural network architectures with the amazing [Kaldi Toolkit](kaldi-asr.org/) to enhance the recogniton accuracy of the application.

**Side projects**: Checkout [*Deer*](https://github.com/abahmed/Deer), an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)-based note-taking application I am building with a group of friends! It is in a very early phase, and we are trying to make it a friendly environment for new contributers to hack on.  
So feel free to code and get in touch, we've got plenty of plans to come!!
