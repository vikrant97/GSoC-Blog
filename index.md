Hello All! I am Vaibhav Gupta, a 3rd year AI enthusiast from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.

The following list of blog posts will be related to **Google Code of Summer**'s project : **Rapid Annotator**, and a detailed account of my adventures, what I learned in the months May through August, obstacles I faced and how finally I overcame those.

I by and large attempt to deliver as per documented in the GSoC Timeline in the proposal. I will endeavor to record each one of the deviations from the solutions / approaches as proposed and settled on in the proposal.
