By the end of community bonding period, I was done with all the requirements elicitation and the designing process.
During this phase, I read many research papers and by drawing inspiration from my research work on Hindi<->English
Machine Translation, I reached a conclusion to build a Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System for TV News 
using **Reinforcement Learning** on the top of neural **attention based encoder-decoder** architecture. This system is 
different from normal NMT system which employs **maximum log-likelihood** training on a given dataset.

This phase is directly headed towards the coding phase of the project. I list down my progress on the project in a
week-wise manner.

# Week-1 (14May-21May,2018)
