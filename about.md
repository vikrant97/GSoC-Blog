Hi there,

I am Ahmed Ismail, a research assistant at
[Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering](http://eng.cu.edu.eg/en/),
and a Masters student at [Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and
Informatics](https://www.fci.cu.edu.eg/).
My main interest is machine learning and its applications within the
domain of computational linguistics.

I am currently working on [Senteech](http://www.dataplusme.com/senteech.html),
a collaborative research project with
[DataPlusME](http://www.dataplusme.com/) that aims to develop a speech
emotion recognizer to aid call centers easily find angry calls within
their huge data sets.

I also previously worked with [RDI](http://www.rdi-eg.com/) on
[the Hafss project](http://www.rdi-eg.com/Technologies/speech.htm),
a pronunciation learning application for Islam's Holy Book
(the Quran). In this project, I explored various deep neural network
architectures with the amazing [Kaldi Toolkit](kaldi-asr.org/)
to enhance the recogniton accuracy of the application.
