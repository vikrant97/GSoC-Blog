Rapid annotator is currently a proof-of-concept. This project aims to deliver a usable product by the end of Google Code of Summer. The final product would be a complete tool for fast and simple classification of datasets and a administrative interface for the experimenters where they can conduct their annotation runs. It broadly comprises of 3 steps, namely

*   Uploading their datasets to setup the experiment.
*   Assigning annotators datasets for annotation.
*   Keeping a track of the annotation progress.

The main aim of the pre project phase was to do requirements gathering, analysis and  designing the complete system architecture. The project phase will deal with implementing the architecture finally decided upon.
